# Analytics Questions

> Note: All questions are evaluated using my own match data. Duo queue is included as context to compare performance conditions, not to analyze or evaluate another player.

This project is driven by questions first, not visuals. The same structure used in business analytics is applied here to gameplay data.

## Overall Performance
- Is my performance improving over time?
- Are there identifiable trends, plateaus, or regressions?
- Which metrics best reflect actual impact rather than surface-level stats?

## Impact on Match Outcomes
- Which individual metrics correlate most strongly with winning?
- Does strong personal performance consistently translate to match wins?
- Are there scenarios where performance is high but outcomes are poor?

## Consistency & Variability
- How consistent is my performance across matches?
- How volatile are my key metrics over time?
- Does performance stability differ by queue type?

## Solo vs Duo Context
- How does win rate differ between solo and duo queue?
- Are performance metrics more stable when playing as a duo?
- Do certain agents or maps perform better in one queue type over another?

## Decision Support
- What areas should I focus on improving first?
- Are there measurable advantages or trade-offs to duo queue?
- What does realistic improvement look like over time?
