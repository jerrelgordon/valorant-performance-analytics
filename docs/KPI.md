# KPIs

Metrics in this project are designed to balance enjoyment with analytical rigor. No single stat is treated as “the truth” — KPIs are evaluated together to form a clearer picture of performance and impact.

## Objective
Improve match impact and win consistency over time, while understanding how queue context affects outcomes.

All KPIs are calculated using my performance data only. Queue type (solo vs duo) is used to segment results and provide context.

## Key Results
- Maintain a positive rolling win rate
- Increase average ACS without increasing deaths disproportionately
- Reduce performance volatility across matches
- Identify meaningful differences between solo and duo queue play

## Core KPIs
- Win Rate (%)
- Kill / Death Ratio (K/D)
- Average Combat Score (ACS)
- Damage per Round
- Headshot Percentage

## Contextual KPIs
- Win Rate by Queue Type
- ACS by Queue Type
- K/D Ratio by Queue Type
- Performance Variance (Solo vs Duo)

## Supporting Metrics
- Assists per Match
- First Bloods
- Clutches Won
- Rounds Played

## Metric Philosophy
KPIs are interpreted within context. Queue type, map, and agent selection are treated as explanatory dimensions rather than performance excuses.
