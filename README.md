# Valorant Performance Analytics (Solo Queue vs Duo Queue)

## Overview
This project analyzes my personal Valorant match data to understand how performance, consistency, and match outcomes change under different play conditions — specifically solo queue versus duo queue.

Although the dataset comes from something I enjoy, the execution is intentionally grounded in Business Intelligence and analytics best practices. The project treats gameplay data the same way operational or product data would be treated: define the right questions, model the data at the correct grain, and evaluate metrics that actually matter.

This analysis focuses exclusively on my individual performance. Playing as a duo is treated as contextual information — a way to understand how outcomes change under different conditions — not as a comparison between players.

## Project Goals
- Measure individual performance over time
- Compare outcomes between solo and duo queue
- Identify which metrics meaningfully correlate with winning
- Practice disciplined BI workflows from ingestion to insight

## What This Project Is
- An end-to-end BI case study
- A data modeling and KPI design exercise
- A practical demonstration of analytics thinking

## What This Project Is Not
- A guide to “getting better at Valorant”
- A tutorial dashboard
- An analysis of my Duo's stats

## Tools & Stack
- Match-level and player-level data (CSV / JSON)
- Power BI Desktop
- Relational modeling concepts
- DAX
